Introduction

GeniusFlow is a hand recognition based interface control program which aims to help
people making presentations in their work or education lives. The camera will recognise
presenters’ simple hand gestures to be able to both control the presentation document, the
interface of the operating system, the default media player and PDF documents. As the
main laptop companies are moving towards KINECT integrated laptops, we chose to work
with KINECT as our camera for our project. Also, we are planning to code an add-in for
Microsoft PowerPoint which will add functions such as highlighting specific lines in
presentations, so that we would imply more gestures to our project. Simply, our aim is to
let the users to create more creative and accessible presentations by preventing them
from using simple remote controls with few button operations.
The main difference of our product from its competitors is its specific target group. Whole
system (both KINECT and its downloadable desktop application) is designed with
prioritising the needs of a presenter in the modern age. Although this group includes
people from various ages and professions, they have many common expectations from
our product. We are trying to build a program with affordable and reasonable specifications
with a fast and stable response system, that will meet up the customer expectations. In
this report, in order to briefly explain how the software systems inside our project actually
work, we will demonstrate block diagrams, flowcharts and user interfaces of our product.
Furthermore, we will be showing the results of the simulations that we’ve conducted during
the course of our project, in order to show our progress.
